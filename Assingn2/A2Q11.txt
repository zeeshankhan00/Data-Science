In probability theory, two events are said to be independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring. In other
words, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.

Here are two examples of independent events:

1. Tossing a coin and rolling a die. The outcome of the coin toss does not affect the probability of any particular outcome on the die, and vice versa. The 
probability of getting heads on the coin toss is 1/2, and the probability of rolling a 3 on the die is 1/6. The probability of getting heads and rolling a 3 is 
the product of their individual probabilities: (1/2) x (1/6) = 1/12.

2. Selecting two cards from a shuffled deck without replacement. The probability of selecting any particular card on the first draw is 1/52. After the first card 
is drawn, there are 51 cards left in the deck, so the probability of selecting any particular card on the second draw is 1/51. The probability of selecting a
particular pair of cards (e.g. the ace of spades and the queen of hearts) is the product of their individual probabilities: (1/52) x (1/51) = 1/2652. Since the
cards are drawn without replacement, the outcome of the first draw does affect the probability of the second draw, but the events are still considered independent
for the purpose of calculating their joint probability.
